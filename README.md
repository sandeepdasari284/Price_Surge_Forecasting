# Price_Surge_Forecasting


The global market is experiencing increased volatility due to economic policies, trade 
regulations, and supply chain disruptions, creating challenges for businesses, 
policymakers, and consumers in predicting and responding to price fluctuations. This study 
investigates the use of data-driven insights to predict price spikes in marketplaces impacted 
by trade regulations, tariffs, and logistical limitations. Historical pricing data, supply chain 
indices, and tariff announcement data are examined using machine learning models 
specifically Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Forecasting, ARIMA, and LSTM and time
series forecasting approaches. The research develops a predictive framework that integrates 
multiple economic indicators such as inflation rates, trade policy shifts, and supply chain 
bottlenecks to provide early warnings of price volatility. The findings demonstrate that 
machine learning techniques can effectively forecast pricing surges resulting from external 
market factors, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making in procurement, 
policy development, and consumer planning.
